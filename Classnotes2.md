## 3/1/23 Create a Bare Bones OPAC Part 1
1. Created opacbb.html and copied code. Put my IP address in. Used `sudo`
2. Created search.php with copied code. Used `sudo`. Put my IP address in
3. Added three files to the opacdb books databases - Olivie Blake, Betty Smith, and Sylvia Plath
4. Conducted searches using Harper and playing around with the dates
**Thoughts: I could see in the code how the webpage was structured with headers and the search functions.
It was also helpful to hear Professor Burns talk about how different ILS's use MySQL or something similar with their databases.
Still not totally clear on connection with php and html? I could see how the code we inputted in the command line equaled the contents on the webpage**
*Side Note to self: Don't forget to put .md after title on GitHub so it uses markdown*
