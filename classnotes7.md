## Notes from 4/20/23

I feel like I should note that the "classnotes" title might be missing numbers
simply because I do not know what number I am actually on. spent 

I spent awhile trying to see how to change the patron view of my OPAC, but I believe
I would need to get familiar with CSS in order to make that happen. It is still capable
of returning the items I added to the collection, but the front page just looks 
somewhat boring.

I spent most of today going over Omeka and adding items and tags. I also changed the
appearance to make it more cohesive with my Wordpress. It was fun adding tags. I feel like
this would be a fun way to keep track of books I read as well.
