## Installing Omeka

1. Upgraded system and restarted
2. I installed ImageMagick
3. Enabled Apache mod_rewrite
4. restarted apache2
5. Created a new user in the database - wrote password down, dbname=omeka
6. Installed unzip
7. Downloaded and unzipped Omeka-3.1
8. Changed data in db.ini file (or tried to, currently struggling with that part)
9. chown command copied from Wordpress instructions
10. Was having difficulty and getting an error message from Omeka after contacting Element chat, I downladed php files
11. Success!
12. Edited Omeka page to show a picture and put some data in

**Thoughts:** This week was a struggle. I did not love being on my own, but I'm happy I figured it out. I found Omeka much easier to use than Wordpress when it came to 
customizing it.
