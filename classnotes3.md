# 3/8/23
1. Remember to change directory to /var/www/html
2. Made pages in nano for index.html and insert.php using Professor's code
3. It worked! Was able to see cataloging page and added two books files
4. Created security for webpage Username:libcat Password is written down
5. Edited apache2/apache2.conf file to allow overrides (made me very nervous)
6. Nerves aside, I created a file for .htaccess and syntax was OK
7. Sign-in appeared when I refreshed the page and I was able to successfully login to the cataloging page

**Thoughts:** I had no issues this week!! I was able to successfully follow all the steps.
I really liked seeing the cataloging interface and it made it so much easier to add records.
I made sooo many typos when entering the books on the command line, so this was a relief.
