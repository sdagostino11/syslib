## 3/21/23 - Installing Wordpress
1. Installed any updates that were available - I had 13 available 
2. Met requirements for MySql and PHP
  - tar.gz=.zip file
3. Changed directory to /var/www/html
4. Extracted wordpress as tar.gz file using `sudo` command, which extracted *lots* of files
5. Switched to Linux root user and then logged into MySQL as root user
6. Created user using same password as before and created wordpress database which showed up, also granted all privileges
7. Copied wp-config-sample.php file and opened in nano
8. renamed DB_Name, DB_User, and DB_Password
9. renamed wordpress to blog
10. Using external IP address, was able to open wordpress site which requested login info
11. Created login information for wordpress site (Written down)
12. Was able to log in!
**Thoughts:** This week was a lot of fun. I'm going to start playing around with my wordpress site now.
I think this will be really useful to know when working in a library if I was expected to help with upkeep of the website.
