## Thoughts:## 
I was really nervous about this week because last week was hard for me. My heart was
beating fast the entire time. I was happy I managed to complete everythin with really
no issues. I am not currently working in a library, so it was also nice to be able to
play around with a library system and check out all the capabilities. There was even a 
way to make labels or send welcome emails on the ILS.
