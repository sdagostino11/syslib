## Notes from 4/19/23
I have been spending today working on updating my different websites.
It is taking some time because I have to search how to do most of the things. I have
some ideas about how to change my Wordpress to look better. I think I'm going to create
a logo, as well as some fake library information.
I am working to add patrons and items to my Koha library, but it is a slow moving
process. I am worried that it will seem like I did not add very much, but the truth is
it's taking a very long time.

I added two servers to the Z39.50/SRU successfully, but when I try to add records that way it 
says that it could not connect or that nothing was found. So I am back to adding things
manually. I have been using the Library of Congress information to help.

I have added just about every pet I've ever had into the Koha database and checked out
a few books. I also put a book on hold for a patron and checked in a book. 

I also typed my troubleshooting a problem assignment about how I figured out how to 
checkout a book

I am working on my Wordpress website now and finally figured out how to make a menu and
attach the pages to it. I am having fun adding information and poking fun at myself in it.
Tomorrow I believe I will continue to make the Wordpress assignment look better, as well
as explore more of Koha and how to make the patron interface look better.
